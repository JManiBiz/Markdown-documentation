            Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to add
            formatting elements to plaintext documents. In 2004, John Gruber and
            Aaron Swartz came together and created Markdown with the sole goal
            of it being readable even in code form. This allows it to be one of
            the world's most popular markup languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Formatting with Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor
            like Microsoft Word. In Word, formatting, such as bold and italics,
            is done with the click of a button and the change is viewed
            instantly. In Markdown, the formatting is done with the keys on the
            keyboard allowing for a fluid motion while typing. Most of the time,
            the changes can not be viewed instantly but can be seen in a web
            browser. However, many applications do allow you to preview the
            formatted document in real-time. The joy of Markdown syntax is that
            it can still be easily read without it being rendered.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many reasons why Markdown is used. Markdown is a very
            versatile markup language that can be used for everything. Websites,
            documents, notes, etc can all be made with Markdown. It is portable
            because Markdown files can be opened using any text editor or
            Markdown specific editors. Because of this, Markdown is also
            platform-independent and can be created on any device with any
            operating system.

        <p>
          The syntax for Markdown is easy to pick up and there isn't a steep
          learning curve. It can be catergorized into two (2) things: Basic
          Syntax and Extended Syntax. Almost all Markdown processors support the
          basic syntax that was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. While
          the basic syntax is enough for ordinary, day-to-day use, the extended
          syntax adds for functionality to Markdown. It brings with it the
          ability to add tables, footnotes, fenced code blocks and automatic URL
          linking. Not all Markdown processors support extended syntax without
          the use of extensions.

          Pound signs (#) are added in front of a word or phrase to create a
          heading. The number of pound signs used should correspond to the
          heading level. For example, a heading level 4 (&#60;h4&#62;) is
          created by using four pound signs (e.g., #### Header).

        <p>
          Here are some of the best practices to maintain when using Markdown:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Headings: Always put a space between the pound sign and the heading
            name and place blank lines before and after a heading.
          </li>
          <li>Paragraphs: Don't indent paragraphs unless it is in a list.</li>
          <li>
            Line Breaks: Using two or more spaces (called "trailing whitespace")
            for line breaks in Markdown is controversial. It is difficult to see
            trailing whitespace in an editor causing persons to put two spaces
            at the end of every sentence. Therefore, if your editor allows it,
            use the HTML &#60;br&#62; tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bold/Italic: Refrain from using underscores in the middle of a word.
            It is best to use asterisks instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ordered Lists: Use periods as a delimiter only and not parenthesis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unordered Lists: Do not mix delimiters in the same list- chose one
            and stick with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Horizontal Rule: Put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.
          </li>
          <li>Links: Encode any spaces in a URL with %20 for compatibility.</li>
        </ul>
