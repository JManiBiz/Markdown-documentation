            Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to add
            formatting elements to plaintext documents. In 2004, John Gruber and
            Aaron came together and created Markdown with the sole goal of it
            being readable even in code form. This allows it to be one of the
            world's most popular markup languages.

            Formatting with Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor
            like Microsoft Word. In Word, formatting, such as bold and italics,
            is done with the click of a button and the change is viewed
            instantly. In Markdown, the formatting is done with the keys on the
            keyboard allowing for a fluid motion while typing. Most of the time,
            the changes can not be viewed instantly but can be seen in a web
            browser. However, many applications do allow you to preview the
            formatted document in real-time. The joy of Markdown syntax is that
            it can still be easily read without it being rendered.

            There are many reasons why Markdown is used. Markdown is a very
            versatile markup language that can be used for everything. Websites,
            documents, notes, etc can all be made with Markdown. It is portable
            because Markdown files can be opened using any text editor or
            Markdown specific editors. Because of this, Markdown is also
            platform-independent and can be created on any device with any
            operating system.
